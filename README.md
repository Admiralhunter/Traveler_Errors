# Traveler_Errors
This R code was used to read an Excel file filled out with errors caught by myself to help visualize and quantify were errors were being missed by our document quality inspectors as well as operations that needed to be improved.
The data would be loaded and then the data was analyzed for each type of error based on part number, day of week, date of operation, whether the quality inspector detected the error or not, and the difference in ratio of errors missed by each of the quality inspectors. The analyze helped upper management determine what changes were necessary in improving quality and modifying operation standards to reduce errors rates.
Note: for the pictures the labels and Y label has been kept to show the necessary data analysis but I have removed the X axis to not reveal company operations and other data. 
The end result of this analysis was almost a complete reduction of the single most common error as shown in the picture "Frequency by Type of Errors.PNG". This analysis also helped provide insight into what areas of operation that will be worked on and improved next.
